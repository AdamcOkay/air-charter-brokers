# Project Info

This project is a test task for [OpenSky](https://opensky.biz).

I have began working on this task at `17:15, 23.09.2023`  and finished it at `21:30, 23.09.2023`. This includes the brakes I took during development

This project uses [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework for the UI and [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management

P.S. If you want to build the app and open `index.html` locally, browser will give you a CORS-error, because of the `type-"module"` attribute. I'd recommend uploading it to some free hosting service or GitHub Pages for testing.
